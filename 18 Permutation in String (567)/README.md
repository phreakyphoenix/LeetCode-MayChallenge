# [Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/) 
[Challenge card](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/may-leetcoding-challenge/536/week-3-may-15th-may-21st/3333/)

Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo" 

Output: True 

Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba"). 

Example 2:

Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo" 

Output: False
 

Note:

The input strings only contain lower case letters. 

The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].
